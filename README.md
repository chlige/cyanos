The CYANOS database system was developed to facilitate data management and mining for natural product drug discovery efforts. This User's Guide provides information on basic usage, e.g. add and view data, of the CYANOS database. Information on the design and implementation of the CYANOS database can be found in the Developer's Guide. The Developer's Guide also provides information for creating SQL queries used in report generation and data mining as well as information on adding features to and creating programs for the CYANOS database. The code for this system is freely available and has been released under the Illinois Open Source license.
