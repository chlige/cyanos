<P>At the heart of the data is the sample that is evaluated biologically and chemically.  
In a natural product drug discovery effort, there are three main classes of samples: crude extracts, fractions, and pure compounds.  
From a hierarchical standpoint, extracts are the children of harvested biomass and are the parent of fractions, via a chemical separation.  
Fractions in turn can be the parent of further fractions as well as purified compounds.

<P>Sample collections, either physical or logical, can be defined to help organize samples and these sample collections can be grouped into sample libraries.</P>
In the case of all three classes, daughter samples can be created for storage libraries or sample submission for biological evaluation.  
A single sample class was defined that would contain common information for all samples, e.g. location, label, date, and amount.  
Specific attributes and relationships are used to define the sample as a crude extract, fraction, or pure compound.  
The source material and resulting fractions of a chemical separation can also linked to the separation record, which stores data relating to the chromatographic parameters.  
All samples can have transaction histories, which links daughter samples and allows a view of the full history of any particular sample.

<P>Sample records can be accessed from a variety of locations within the CYANOS web interface.  The primary methods to access samples are via the <I>Samples</I> sections found on a strain's or sample collection's data page. 
Sample collections can be access via the menu option <B>Samples</B> &gt; <B>Browse</B>.  Use the pull down field to select the desired sample collection.  Please note that sample collections are grouped by library.</P>

Separation can be created from extracts or other fractions.  
Separation records would include information about the chromatographic phases as well as the method used to perform the separation. 
Currently, the only way to add separation records is to create a spreadsheet, that details the separation, and upload into the database.
